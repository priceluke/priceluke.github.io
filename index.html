						I am a Lecturer (i.e. Assistant Professor) at the University of Surrey, UK and member of the Surrey Centre for Cyber Security (SCCS), a GCHQ---recognised UK Academic Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security Research.<br />Research interests: I am studying cyber security and privacy engineering and decision-making approaches from both a theoretical and practical perspective. I have expertise in developing new models within the above fields and proposing algorithms or methodologies to tackle emerging challenges. I enjoy assessing my theoretical propositions by either simulations (mainly by using Python tools or network event-based simulators) or real-world testbeds.
